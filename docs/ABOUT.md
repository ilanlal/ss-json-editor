# About JSON Studio

The "JSON Studio" is a simple Google Sheets™️ add-on that allows users to edit and validate JSON data in a Google Sheets™️.

## Features

- **Edit**: Edit JSON data in specific cells. Modify the JSON data directly in the cell without any additional tools.
- **Validate**: Validate JSON data for a specific range of cells. Check if the JSON data is valid or not for each cell in the range, and highlight the cells with invalid JSON data.
- **Beautify**: Beautify all JSON data in a specific range of cells. Format JSON data in a human-readable way.
- **Minify**: Minify all JSON data in a specific range of cells. Remove all unnecessary whitespace and newlines from JSON data.

## How it works

This add-on uses the [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) platform to provide a custom menu in Google Sheets™️ that allows users to edit and validate JSON data.
