This Google Sheetsâ„¢ add-on that allows users to format JSON data directly within their spreadsheets. It provides a user-friendly interface for working with JSON data, making it easier to manage and manipulate structured data.

If you are looking for a **simple way to prettify or minify JSON data** in your Google Sheetsâ„¢ cell, this add-on is for you! ðŸ˜‰

## What can you do with this add-on?

If you have raw JSON in a cell like this:

```json
{"name": "John", 
"age": 30, 
"city": "New York"}
```

You can select the cell and click Prettify. It will transform it into:

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

Click Minify, and it will compress it into a single line:

```json
{"name":"John","age":30,"city":"New York"}
```

## Use Cases for Json Studio

  Here are some common use cases for web developers and API consumers:

  1. **API Response Formatting:** When working with APIs, the response data is often in JSON format. Json Studio allows you to format and manipulate this data directly within Google Sheetsâ„¢, making it easier to analyze and visualize.

  2. **Collaborative Data Editing:** Json Studio enables multiple users to collaborate on JSON data within a Google Sheetsâ„¢ environment. This is particularly useful for teams working on API integrations or data analysis projects.

  3. **Educational Purposes:** Json Studio can be used as a teaching tool to help students understand JSON structure and data manipulation. It provides a hands-on approach to learning about APIs and data formats.
